# Swarm
Swarm is a Unity game written in C# which implements search algorithms to find optimal paths.

<b>Current Algorithms: </b>

<b>AStar </b> - An algorithm that uses a direction hueristic to allow the algorithm to navigate very optimally through the terrain. Works very well in this situation because it is traversing towards a goal node which is known at the time of execution. This algorithm is used for character movement in many games.

<b>Breadth First Search </b>- A classic algorithm which searches outward from the node through the closest nodes first. This returns the guarenteed shortest path once the goal node is hit.

<b>Bi-Directional Breadth First Search</b> - Searches from both the start and goal nodes to increase the time efficiency that is taken to complete the search. This implementation helps significantly with "traps" in place on the map such as large areas with the goal node right behind it.

Next version of this project will include:
  1. "Best Algorithm Analysis" using introductory AI
  2. Improved error checking
  3. Increased controls such as dynamic goal movement.

To setup the tilemap in Unity I followed a tutorial by InScope Studios: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVsCcTte38YC9CxJtw3hBQ.
