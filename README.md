# Swarm
Swarm is a Unity game written in C# which implements search algorithms to find optimal paths. 


Currently Swarm has the AStar algorithm implemented with visualization to assist in understanding the steps the algorithm would take to find the optimal path. 
To complete the AStar algorithm and setup the tilemap in Unity I followed a tutorial by InScope Studios: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyVsCcTte38YC9CxJtw3hBQ. I further built on this tutorial by adding by frame update to the algorithm and future updates will be implementing different algorithms such as Depth-First and Breadth-First search.
